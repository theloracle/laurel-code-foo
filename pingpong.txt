How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an
average-sized school bus?
Describe each step in your thought process. 

The calculation is estimation-based, so the precise measurements are unknown and analogs are chosen to
determine numerical measurements.

Determine the approximate size of the school bus:
    The calculation uses adult estimates because high school students and adult supervisors fit on buses.

    The bus has to seat a class of children.
        Approximate that the bus has a 32 person capacity.
        There are 4 seats per row.
        Therefore, the bus has 8 rows of seats.

    Calculation needs to subtract out the space taken up by seats and account for the entry stairs and
    driver's seat.

    Approximate that the aisle is equivalent to the width of a person
        The width of the bus is 5 people wide; 4 people for each of the seats and 1 person for the aisle.

    The height is assumed to be 6-feet, because of the adult person scale and it is a nice round number.
        The top of bus is rounded, but that is ignored to simplify the estimation.

    The length of row is 3 feet, accounting for 2 feet for seat and 1 foot for leg room.
        The length of the entire seated section is 24 feet (3*8 rows of seats).

    The set of stairs is assumed to have 2 stairs.
        Each stair is .5 feet high, 2 feet wide, .5 feet deep.
        Three 2' x 0.5' x 0.5'(W x L x H) rectangles, two for the space above each stair and the third
        for the space above the space above the lower stair.

            S[][]   S: the stair
            SSS[]   []: the space

    For the driver's seat, add another row to the length of the bus but subtract out the space of one
    seat and not two.


The size of a ping pong ball and using it as a unit of measurement:
    Wikipedia says the diameter of a ping pong ball is 40mm diameter  or ~1.6 in. I am lacking
    experience for a good estimate.
    
    The relative size of 40mm in relation to an adult person estimate.
        A person is estimated to be about 2 feet wide and 6 feet tall, for the convenience of round
        numbers.
        The width of a person is equivalent to 15 ping pong balls.
        And the height of a person is equivalent to 45 ping pong balls.


Ping pong ball stacking
    Negate entropy and assume an ordered arrangement of ping pong balls carefully placed to fit
    the maximum number of balls.

    The maximum arrangement is not stacked directly on top of on another, and some physical
    constraints should be taken into account. The most efficient use of space is to stack the ping
    pong balls like this:
    o o o
     o o
    o o o.
        The height estimation needs to account for the height lost from overlap of the levels of
        ping pong balls.
        Marbles were stacked to determine the amount of overlap from stacking. The image pingpong.JPG
        shows the stack. The representation illustrates that about a third of the height of the ping
        pong ball is lost to overlap. The first row will maintain its full height.
        
        Every other level has n-1 columns and rows to account for the stacking, n being the maximum
        number of columns and rows.

    height = 1.6"+(n-1*(1.6*(2/3))) n being the number of levels of balls
    n = ((h-1.6)/(1.6*(2/3))) + 1

Assume windows are closed and the space is contained.

Width
      5 people wide at 2 feet per person -> 10 feet ->
      75 ping pong balls to cover the width of the bus
Length
      9 rows at 3 feet per row -> 27 feet -> 202.5 ping pong balls
       -> round to 203 because estimations are more likely under
Height
     one person at 6 feet -> Using equation 67 levels of ping pong balls
      -> 34 odd number levels, 33 even number levels

Odd level: array of 75x203 : 15,225 ping pong balls
Even level: array of 74x202 : 14,948 ping pong balls

Total assuming empty bus =
  (34*15225) + (33*14948) = 517,650 + 493,284 = 1,010,934 ping pong balls

Stairs
    width: 2 feet -> 15 ping pong balls
    length: 0.5 feet -> 3.75 -> round up to 4 ping pong balls
    height: 0.5 feet -> using equation 5.125 levels -> 3 odd number levels, 2 even number levels
    odd level: 15x4 -> 60 ping pong balls
    even level: 14x3 -> 42 ping pong balls
    Stairs total: (3*60) + (2*42) = 180 + 84 = 264 ping pong balls

Total for an empty bus with stairs = 1,011,198 ping pong balls

Space taken up by seats
    Seats have a horizontal portion and a vertical portion that both need to be taken into account.
        Estimate two levels high for horizontal portion and a 2 feet (already estimated when calculating
        the length of the row) by 4 feet (width of two people) rectangle.
        For the vertical portion estimate a two ping pong ball depth, 4 feet wide (match the horizontal
        portion) and 3 feet high (backing equivalent to half the height of a person).
    
    horizontal
        2 feet (15 balls) x 4 feet (30 balls) ->
        large array (15x30) 450 balls, small array (14x29) 406 balls
        height -> 1 large array, 1 small array
        total = 856 balls

    vertical
        2 balls x 4 feet (30 balls) ->
         large array (2x30) 60 balls, small array (1x29) 29 balls
         height -> 3 feet -> Using equation 33.25 levels round down to 33
          -> 17 large arrays, 16 small arrays
        total = 17(60) + 16(29) = 1020 + 464 = 1,484

    Seat -> -2,340 ping pong balls
    17 seats -> -39,780 ping pong balls

Total ping pong balls (removing area taken up by seating) = 1,011,198 - 39,780 =

  971,418 ping pong balls
