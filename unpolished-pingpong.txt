Just in case you think more in bullet points and less in sentences.

How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an
average-sized school bus?
Describe each step in your thought process. 


Size of the school bus
  Using adult estimates because high school students
   and adult supervisors fit on buses

  has to seat a class of children -> approximate 32
  4 seats per row -> 8 rows of seats
      Need to subtract out the space taken up by seats

  entry stairs and driver's seat

  aisle -> person width
  Width of the bus is 5 people wide

  height -> like 6-foot?
      top of bus is rounded -> ignore?

  length of row -> like 3 feet
      2 feet for seat, 1 foot for leg room
  length of seated section is 24 feet

  Stairs -> 2 stairs, .5 feet high, 2 feet wide, .5 feet deep
  (W x L x H) 3 2' x 0.5' x 0.5' rectangles (all 2/3 high ping pong)

 Driver's Seat: add another row, only subtract one seat not two

  Seats:
  two levels high for horizontal portion, 2' x 4' rectangle
  vertical -> two depth, 4 feet wide,  3 feet high

Size of a ping pong ball
  Wikipedia says 40mm diameter (~1.6 in) (I'm lacking experience for a good estimate)
  40mm in relative terms
      person is about 2ft by 6ft (for the convenience of round numbers)
      15 ping pong balls wide
      45 ping pong balls high
))
Ping pong ball stacking
  negate entropy-> assume ordered arrangement
  carefully placed to fit maximum number of balls

  not stacked directly on top of on another
      o o o
       o o
      o o o
  need account for the height lost from nestling balls
  stacked marbles and found that they roll counterproductively (sarcastically surprised),
   and getting a perfect stack is unlikely at best, but assuming
   the impropable happened (or super friction)
   lose about a third of the height of the circle in the previous row
  every other level has n-1 columns and rows

  first level height = ping pong ball
  2 to top height = 2/3 ping pong ball
  height = 1.6"+(n-1*(1.6*(2/3))) n being the number of levels of balls
  n = ((h-1.6)/(1.6*(2/3))) + 1

Assume windows are closed

Width
      5 people wide -> 10 feet -> 75 ping pong balls to cover the width of the bus
Length
      9 rows at 3 feet per row -> 27 feet -> 202.5 ping pong balls
       -> round to 203 because estimations are more likely under
Height
     one person standing -> 6 feet -> Using equation 67 levels of ping pong balls
      -> 34 odd number levels, 33 even number levels

Odd level: array of 75x203 : 15,225 ping pong balls
Even level: array of 74x202 : 14,948 ping pong balls

Total assuming empty bus =
  (34*15225) + (33*14948) = 517,650 + 493,284 = 1,010,934 ping pong balls

Stairs
    No full height row, all 2/3
	n = h/1.6*(2/3) 
    width: 2 feet -> 15 ping pong balls
    length: 0.5 feet -> 3.75 -> round up to 4 ping pong balls
    height: 0.5 feet -> using equation 5.625 levels (round up) -> 3 odd number levels, 3 even number levels
    odd level: 15x4 -> 60 ping pong balls
    even level: 14x3 -> 42 ping pong balls
    Stairs total: (3*60) + (3*42) = 180 +126 = 306 ping pong balls

Total for an empty bus with stairs = 1,011,240 ping pong balls

Space taken up by seats
  horizontal
    2 feet (15 balls) x 4 feet (30 balls) ->
     large array (15x30) 450 balls, small array (14x29) 406 balls
     height -> 1 large array, 1 small array
    total = 856 balls

  vertical
    2 balls x 4 feet (30 balls) ->
     large array (2x30) 60 balls, small array (1x29) 29 balls
     height -> 3 feet -> Using equation 33.25 levels round down to 33
      -> 17 large arrays, 16 small arrays
    total = 17(60) + 16(29) = 1020 + 464 = 1484

  Seat -> -2340 ping pong balls
  17 seats -> -39,780 ping pong balls

Total ping pong balls (removing area taken up by seating)
  971,460
